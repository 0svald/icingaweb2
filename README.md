Vagrant
-------

The Icinga 2 Web project ships with a Vagrant virtual machine that integrates
the source code with various services and example data in a controlled
environment. This enables developers and users to test Livestatus, status.dat,
MySQL and PostgreSQL backends as well as the LDAP authentication. All you
have to do is install Vagrant and run:

     vagrant up
