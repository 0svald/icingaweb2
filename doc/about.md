# <a id="about"></a> About Icinga Web 2

Icinga Web 2 is a powerful PHP framework for web applications that comes in a clean and reduced design.
It's fast, responsive, accessible and easily extensible with modules.

## <a id="about-monitoring"></a> The monitoring module

This is the core module for most Icinga Web 2 users.

It provides an intuitive user interface for monitoring with Icinga (1 and 2).
Especially there are lots of list and detail views (e.g. for hosts and services)
you can sort and filter depending on what you want to see.

You can also control the monitoring process itself by sending external commands to Icinga.
Most such actions (like rescheduling a check) can be done with just a single click.
